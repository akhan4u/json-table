# json-table [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/micha/json-table.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/micha/json-table)

**Jt** transforms JSON data structures into tables of columns and rows for
processing in the shell.

Extracting information from deeply nested JSON data is difficult and unreliable
with tools like **sed** and **awk**, and tools that are specially designed for
manipulating JSON are cumbersome to use in the shell because they either return
their results as JSON or introduce a new turing complete scripting language
that needs to be quoted and constructed via string interpolation.

**Jt** provides only what is needed to extract data from nested JSON data
structures and organize the data into a table. Tools like **cut**, **paste**,
**join**, **sort**, **uniq**, etc. can be used to efficiently reduce the
tabular data to produce the final result.

#### Features

* **Self contained** &mdash; statically linked, has no build or runtime dependencies.
* **Fast, small memory footprint** &mdash; efficiently process **large** JSON input.
* **Streaming mode** &mdash; reads JSON objects one-per-line e.g., from log files.

#### Example

You can get an idea of what **jt** can do from this one-liner that produces
a table of ELB names to EC2 instance IDs from the complex JSON returned by the
`aws elb` tool:

```
$ aws elb describe-load-balancers \
  |jt LoadBalancerDescriptions [ LoadBalancerName % ] Instances InstanceId %
elb-1	i-94a6f73a
elb-2	i-b910a256
...
```

## INSTALL

Linux users can install prebuilt binaries from the release tarball:

```
sudo bash -c "cd /usr/local && wget -O - https://github.com/micha/json-table/raw/master/jt.tar.gz | tar xzvf -"
```

Otherwise, build from source:

```
make && make test && sudo make install
```
